This document outlines a series of short, focused video tutorials for the extension's key features.

General Style
Duration: 60-90 seconds per video.

Format: Screencast with voiceover and highlighted mouse clicks/keystrokes.

Pacing: Fast-paced and to the point.

Platform: YouTube Shorts, TikTok, X (Twitter).

Video 1: Quick Start & API Key Setup (60s)
Goal: Get a new user up and running in one minute.

Scene 1: (0-15s) Quick demo of the AI chat answering a question. Voiceover: "Here's how to get AI-powered chat in your editor in 60 seconds."

Scene 2: (15-30s) Show finding the extension in the VS Code marketplace and clicking "Install".

Scene 3: (30-55s) Show opening settings, searching for "My AI Extension", and pasting in an API key. Emphasize the security feature.

Scene 4: (55-60s) Back to the chat, show it working. Voiceover: "And you're all set!" End screen with a link to the extension.

Video 2: Master the AI Chat (90s)
Goal: Showcase the power and flexibility of the chat panel.

Scene 1: (0-30s) Ask a general project question using the "Workspace" context. Show the AI pulling in code from multiple files to form its answer.

Scene 2: (30-60s) Switch to a specific file. Select the "Current File" context. Ask a detailed question about a function in that file. Show the more focused answer.

Scene 3: (60-80s) Demonstrate the provider-switching dropdown. Show the same question being asked to two different models to compare responses.

Scene 4: (80-90s) Show the "Copy Code" button and pasting the AI's suggestion directly into the editor.

Video 3: Effortless Unit Testing (75s)
Goal: Demonstrate the speed of the test generation feature.

Scene 1: (0-20s) Show a standard TypeScript function without any tests. Voiceover: "Tired of writing boilerplate for tests? Watch this."

Scene 2: (20-45s) Highlight the function, right-click, navigate to "AI Assistant > Generate Unit Tests". A new test file appears.

Scene 3: (45-65s) Briefly scroll through the generated test file, pointing out the mocks, assertions, and edge cases that were automatically created.

Scene 4: (65-75s) Open a terminal and run the test command (e.g., npm test). Show the tests passing.

Video 4: Inline Completions That Understand Your Code (60s)
Goal: Differentiate the extension's RAG-based completions from simpler alternatives.

Scene 1: (0-20s) In a component file, start typing a call to a utility function that's defined in a different file.

Scene 2: (20-45s) The inline completion appears, correctly suggesting the rest of the function call, including the parameters. The voiceover explains: "The AI has read your entire workspace to understand how your functions connect."

Scene 3: (45-60s) Hit Tab to accept the completion. The code is complete. Voiceover: "Code faster with context-aware completions."
