Key Features
ðŸ’¬ Context-Aware AI Chat

âš¡ Inline Code Completions
Move faster with intelligent code completions that understand your project's structure. Our assistant analyzes your code to provide relevant, accurate suggestions that go beyond simple autocompletes.

âœ… One-Click Test Generation
Select a function or class, right-click, and choose "Generate Unit Tests". The extension will create a complete test file with mocks and realistic scenarios for Jest, Vitest, Pytest, and more.
